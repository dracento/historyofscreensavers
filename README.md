# The history of screensavers
One of my small projects: The history of screensavers divided in 4 slides with the topics:
1. Why screensavers?
2. early screensavers
3. the DVD-screensaver
4. why screensavers (actually) aren't needed anymore today

*The website also includes the sources of information and images.*

## How I developed it
The project is based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Shoutout to hakimel who developed it.
The code has been edited in Visual Studio Code.
